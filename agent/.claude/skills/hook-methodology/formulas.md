# Hook Principles Reference

**Purpose:** Understand WHY hooks work, not templates to copy. Use for validation after you've crafted hooks through insight.

## The Psychology of Stopping the Scroll

People scroll on autopilot. To stop them, you must trigger one of these responses:

### Pattern Interrupt
The brain notices what doesn't fit. Unexpected specificity, unusual framing, or contradiction to assumed reality.

**What creates it:**
- Specific numbers where vague claims are expected
- Naming something people feel but haven't heard articulated
- Contradicting common industry messaging

### Self-Reference
The brain prioritizes information about itself. "You" and identity markers activate self-relevant processing.

**What creates it:**
- Direct address to a specific situation
- Identity markers ("If you're someone who...")
- Naming their internal experience

### Open Loop
The brain wants closure. Incomplete information creates tension that demands resolution.

**What creates it:**
- Revealing that something hidden exists without showing it
- Implying a story without telling it
- Suggesting knowledge they don't have

### Emotional Resonance
The brain responds to feeling faster than logic. Emotion creates engagement before comprehension.

**What creates it:**
- Naming a feeling they have
- Validating frustration or fear
- Offering relief or hope

## Validation Principles

After crafting hooks through insight, use these to validate. **Not to generate.**

### Specificity Principle

Specific beats generic. Always.

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| Round numbers | Exact figures from research |
| General claims | Particular situations |
| Category language | Individual experience |

**Test:** Could you make this MORE specific without losing clarity?

### Tension Principle

Hooks need inherent tension — something unresolved that demands attention.

**Sources of tension:**
- Gap between expectation and reality
- Contrast between two states
- Conflict between what is and what should be
- Unfinished story

**Test:** Is there something unresolved that creates pull?

### Ownership Principle

The best hook is one only you can use.

**Sources of ownership:**
- Your specific proof points
- Your specific customer's language
- Your specific perspective on the problem
- Your specific results

**Test:** Could a competitor swap in their logo and use this?

### Conversation Principle

You're not starting a conversation. You're entering one already happening.

**The conversation already happening:**
- Their fears at 2am
- What they complain about to friends
- The thing they Google but don't ask out loud
- The frustration they've accepted as normal

**Test:** Would your customer read this and think "finally, someone gets it"?

### Simplicity Principle

If it takes more than 3 seconds to understand, it fails.

**Enemies of clarity:**
- Clever wordplay that requires processing
- Multiple ideas in one hook
- Industry jargon
- Hedging or qualifiers

**Test:** Read it fast, once. Did you get it?

## Emotional Territories

Hooks can land in different emotional places. Ensure variety across your 6 concepts.

**Not categories to fill. Territories to cover.**

### Fear / Protection
The instinct to avoid loss, danger, or regret.
> Activated by: what they might lose, what could go wrong, what they're risking

### Hope / Aspiration
The pull toward a better future self or situation.
> Activated by: what becomes possible, who they could become, what they deserve

### Frustration / Anger
The energy of unfairness or broken expectations.
> Activated by: naming what's wrong, exposing what's hidden, validating their anger

### Relief / Comfort
The exhale of a problem solved or burden lifted.
> Activated by: making the complex simple, removing obstacles, offering support

### Pride / Identity
The need to be seen as the person they believe themselves to be.
> Activated by: reflecting their values, acknowledging their situation, tribal markers

### Curiosity / Intrigue
The pull toward hidden information or unexpected insight.
> Activated by: revealing that something exists they didn't know, opening loops

## Common Failure Modes

### The Template Trap
Starting with a formula and filling in blanks produces generic output. The formula should validate, not generate.

### The Cleverness Trap
Wordplay that makes the writer feel smart but makes the reader work. Clarity beats clever.

### The Features Trap
Listing what you do instead of what it means to them. Features are external. Hooks need internal or philosophical depth.

### The Everyone Trap
Trying to appeal to the whole category instead of speaking precisely to your specific customer.

### The First Thought Trap
The obvious hook is obvious to everyone. Your first instinct is usually the same as every competitor's first instinct.

### The Jargon Trap
Using industry language that signals "this is marketing" instead of human language that signals "I understand you."

## Mapping to Research

When validating hooks, trace each one back to research:

| Hook Element | Should Come From |
|--------------|------------------|
| Specific numbers | Proof Points, The Offer |
| Customer language | ICP section verbatim phrases |
| Emotional truth | Pain Points, Testimonials |
| Unique angle | Value Props + brand's specific perspective |
| Brand voice | Brand Voice section |

If you can't trace a hook element to research, it might be invention. Invention is weak. Discovery is strong.

## Final Check

Before finalizing any hook, ask:

1. **Is this true?** (Can we actually say this? Is there proof?)
2. **Is this ours?** (Can only we say this?)
3. **Is this felt?** (Does it name an emotion, not just a fact?)
4. **Is this clear?** (3 seconds or less?)
5. **Is this them?** (Their words? Their world?)

If any answer is no, the hook isn't ready.

## Remember

This document exists to help you evaluate hooks you've already created through insight.

If you find yourself using this to GENERATE hooks, stop. Go back to the research. Sit with it. Find what makes you feel something.

The best hook is hiding in the research. Your job is to find it, not to construct it from templates.
