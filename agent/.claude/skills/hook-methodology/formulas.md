# Hook Types Reference

**Purpose:** Detailed definitions and examples for the 10 hook types. Use this after extraction to match research elements to the right hook format.

## Attention Hooks (Stop the Scroll)

These hooks interrupt the autopilot scroll. They create a moment of "wait, what?" that forces attention.

---

### 1. Question Hook

**Purpose:** Challenge an assumption or make them self-identify

**Psychology:** Questions activate self-reference processing. The brain can't ignore a question directed at it.

**Structure:** Ask about their situation, challenge their belief, or imply hidden knowledge

**Examples:**
```
"Still waiting for your bank to call back?"
"What if the problem isn't your income?"
"How long will you let one rejection define your options?"
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points (frame their problem as a question)
- ICP Language (use their exact phrasing)

**Warning:** Don't ask questions you don't answer. The body must deliver.

---

### 2. Surprising Stat Hook

**Purpose:** Stop scroll with an unexpected number

**Psychology:** Specific numbers create credibility and pattern interrupt. The brain notices specificity in a world of vague claims.

**Structure:** Lead with the number. Make it unexpected or contrarian.

**Examples:**
```
"$547,500 mortgage. Approved in 24 hours."
"856 reviews. 4.8 stars. Zero bank stress."
"350+ lenders. You only need one."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Proof Points (real deals, ratings, stats)
- The Offer (rates, speeds, capacities)
- Value Props (specific differentiators)

**Warning:** Never round or estimate. Use exact figures from research.

---

### 3. Pattern Interrupt Hook

**Purpose:** Say something unexpected that breaks normal ad patterns

**Psychology:** The brain filters out predictable patterns. Unexpected framing forces conscious attention.

**Structure:** Contradict what they expect to see. Flip the normal frame.

**Examples:**
```
"Your income isn't complicated. Their process is."
"We don't do mortgages. We do rescues."
"Banks optimize for their risk. We optimize for yours."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points (reframe who's at fault)
- Value Props (flip the industry norm)
- Brand Voice (their unique perspective)

**Warning:** Must still be believable. Unexpected ≠ unbelievable.

---

### 4. Controversial Hook

**Purpose:** Challenge a common belief or industry assumption

**Psychology:** Controversy creates emotional activation. Agreement or disagreement both create engagement.

**Structure:** Challenge what everyone accepts. Name the uncomfortable truth.

**Examples:**
```
"Banks don't want you to know about private lenders."
"Your mortgage broker is only showing you 5 options. We show you 350."
"The system isn't broken. It's working exactly as designed—against you."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points (expose what's unfair)
- Value Props (contrast with industry norm)
- Their Messaging (if they have a challenger brand voice)

**Warning:** Must be defensible. Don't make claims you can't support.

---

### 5. Direct Address Hook

**Purpose:** Call out a specific situation so precisely they feel seen

**Psychology:** Self-reference is the brain's priority. Naming their exact situation triggers "this is about ME."

**Structure:** Describe their situation in their words. Be specific.

**Examples:**
```
"Self-employed. Solid income. Bank said no."
"First-time buyer with 'non-traditional' income."
"Investor needing BRRR financing by Friday."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- ICP Segments (WHO + their LANGUAGE)
- Products/Services (specific solutions for specific situations)
- Pain Points (exact problem statements)

**Warning:** Specificity is power. "Homebuyer" is weak. "Self-employed homebuyer rejected twice" is strong.

---

## Desire Hooks (Drive Clicks)

These hooks create pull toward action. They make the click feel inevitable.

---

### 6. Social Proof Hook

**Purpose:** Build credibility through collective validation

**Psychology:** Social proof shortcuts decision-making. If others did it, it must be safe/good.

**Structure:** Lead with numbers of people, ratings, or testimonial essence.

**Examples:**
```
"856 Canadians gave us 4.8 stars. Here's why."
"Approved in 2 days with a great rate." — Sarah M.
"Join 16,000+ who stopped guessing."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Proof Points (ratings, reviews, deal counts)
- Testimonials (exact quotes, specific results)

**Warning:** Don't fabricate or inflate. Use exact numbers from research.

---

### 7. Problem-Solution Hook

**Purpose:** Name the pain, hint at relief

**Psychology:** Pain recognition creates trust ("they get it"). Solution hint creates hope.

**Structure:** State problem in their words → Bridge to solution

**Examples:**
```
"Rejected by banks? We specialize in approvals they won't touch."
"Confused by options? Our AI shows you the one that fits."
"Need to close fast? 24-48 hours. Not 4-6 weeks."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points Addressed (exact pain + solution pairs)
- Products/Services (specific solutions)
- ICP Language (their words for the problem)

**Warning:** Don't minimize the pain. Acknowledge it fully before offering relief.

---

### 8. Contrast Hook

**Purpose:** Show the gap between bad and good, before and after

**Psychology:** Contrast creates clarity. The brain processes difference faster than absolute statements.

**Structure:** [Their current reality] vs. [What you offer]

**Examples:**
```
"Banks take weeks. We close in 48 hours."
"One bank's criteria vs. 350 lenders' options."
"Guessing at rates vs. seeing every option."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points (current bad state)
- Value Props (your better state)
- Proof Points (specific better numbers)

**Warning:** The contrast must be provable. Don't exaggerate the gap.

---

### 9. FOMO/Urgency Hook

**Purpose:** Create time pressure or fear of missing out

**Psychology:** Loss aversion is stronger than gain desire. Scarcity accelerates action.

**Structure:** Imply limited time, competitive pressure, or shrinking opportunity

**Examples:**
```
"The house won't wait for your bank's timeline."
"While you wait for approval, someone else is making an offer."
"Rates are moving. Are you?"
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Pain Points (time-sensitive situations)
- Products/Services (rush closing, emergency financing)
- ICP Motivations (competitive market pressure)

**Warning:** False urgency backfires. Use real scarcity from research.

---

### 10. Curiosity Hook

**Purpose:** Tease hidden information that demands discovery

**Psychology:** Open loops create tension. The brain seeks closure.

**Structure:** Hint at something hidden, unknown, or surprising without revealing it

**Examples:**
```
"What your bank isn't telling you about your options."
"The approval path 90% of Canadians don't know exists."
"There's a reason banks don't mention us."
```

**Best Research Sources:**
- Value Props (unique things others don't offer)
- Products/Services (niche products most don't know about)
- Pain Points (hidden causes of their problems)

**Warning:** The body MUST deliver on the curiosity. Don't tease without payoff.

## Research-to-Hook Mapping Guide

Use this to quickly identify which hook types fit which research elements:

| Research Section | Primary Hook Types | Why |
|------------------|-------------------|-----|
| **The Offer** | Surprising Stat, Contrast | Numbers and speed create contrast |
| **Key Value Props** | Pattern Interrupt, Curiosity, Contrast | Differentiators challenge norms |
| **Proof Points** | Surprising Stat, Social Proof | Real numbers build credibility |

## Emotional Territory Coverage

Ensure your hooks span different emotional responses:

### Fear / Protection
> Activated by: what they might lose, what could go wrong, what they're risking
```
"While you wait for approval, someone else is making an offer."
```

### Hope / Aspiration
> Activated by: what becomes possible, who they could become
```
"New to Canada. Ready to own it."
```

### Frustration / Anger
> Activated by: naming what's wrong, exposing what's hidden
```
"Your income isn't complicated. Their process is."
```

### Relief / Comfort
> Activated by: making complex simple, removing obstacles
```
"350 lenders. You only need the right one."
```

### Pride / Identity
> Activated by: reflecting their values, acknowledging their situation
```
"You built a business. Banks see a problem."
```

### Curiosity / Intrigue
> Activated by: hidden information, unexpected insight
```
"What your bank isn't telling you about your options."
```

---

## Validation Principles

After constructing hooks, validate against these:

### Specificity
Could this be MORE specific without losing clarity?
```
Weak: "Fast approvals"
Strong: "48-hour approval when banks take 3 weeks"
```

### Tension
Is there something unresolved that creates pull?
```
Weak: "We have good rates"
Strong: "Banks take weeks. We close in 48 hours." (contrast = tension)
```

### Ownership
Could a competitor swap in their logo and use this?
```
Weak: "Get the best mortgage rate" (anyone can say this)
Strong: "350+ lenders. You only need one." (specific to network size)
```

### Conversation
Does this enter a conversation already happening in their head?
```
Weak: "Quality mortgage services" (marketing speak)
Strong: "Bank said no?" (their actual thought)
```

### Clarity
3 seconds or less to understand?
```
Weak: "Leveraging AI-powered technology for optimal lending solutions"
Strong: "AI finds your best lender. In seconds."
```

## Remember

This reference helps you MATCH and VALIDATE, not GENERATE.

The hook comes from the research first. Then you identify which type it is. Then you validate it works.

If you're starting with a type and filling in blanks, you're doing it backwards.

Research → Discovery → Type Match → Validation
