# Viral Meme Creation

This is not a recipe. It's a lens.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- User requests "memes", "viral content", "funny ads", or "humor-based" marketing
- Brand tone allows entertainment-first content
- Goal is organic reach and shareability over direct conversion

## The Golden Rule

**70% entertainment, 30% brand (at most)**

If it feels like an ad, it won't spread.

---

## Hard Constraints

| Never Do | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Copy existing meme formats (Drake, etc.) | Templates scream "marketing team" |
| Use marketing language | Only words customers actually say |
| Make brand the hero | Customer's struggle is the hero |
| Explain the joke | If it needs explanation, it's dead |
| Require context to be funny | Must hit instantly |
| Be preachy or toxic-positive | Acknowledge real struggle |

---

## Emotional Targets

Pick **ONE** per concept:

| Target | Feeling | Signs Working |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Catharsis | "Finally someone said it" | Tagging friends, "THIS" |
| Validation | "This is SO me" | Screenshots, identity expression |
| Surprise | "Wait, what?" | Comments, debates |
| Belonging | "My people get this" | Niche community spread |
| Hope | "Maybe there's a way" | Saves, encouragement shares |

---

## Humor Patterns

| Pattern | Energy | Best For |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Self-deprecating | "I'm a mess but funny" | Shared struggles |
| Observational | "Why is this SO true?" | Universal moments |
| Absurdist | "Makes no sense but YES" | Breaking patterns |
| Wholesome | "I needed this today" | Genuine support |
| Dark/Gallows | "At least we can laugh" | Heavy topics, solidarity |

## The 11pm Test

Before shipping: **"Would I send this to a friend at 11pm with no context?"**

- No → Delete it
- Yes → Ship it

---

## Extraction Process

**Step 1: Pain Mining** - Read research with "what sucks" glasses. Find frustrations, struggles, industry BS.

**Step 2: Language Hunt** - Find exact phrases customers use. Slang, complaints, inside jokes.

**Step 3: Tension ID** - What's the gap between expectation vs reality? The shared secret nobody says?

**Step 4: Emotional Match** - Which target fits? Match humor pattern to brand's tone ceiling.

**Step 5: Crystallize** - One pain + one emotion + one humor pattern = one concept.

## Platform Matrix

| Platform | Vibe | Works | Avoid |
|----------|------|-------|-------|
| Instagram | Aesthetic | Clean design, carousels | Ugly visuals, text walls |
| Twitter/X | Sharp, fast | Text-first, hot takes | Over-produced |
| TikTok | Chaotic | Absurdist, lo-fi | "Fellow kids" energy |
| LinkedIn | Professional | Work-life humor, insider | Anything to hide from boss |

---

## B2B Playbook

| Angle | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Industry Insider | Jokes only this field gets |
| Tool Struggle | "Me at 2am finally using it" |
| Meeting Hell | Calendar memes, Zoom fatigue |
| Vendor Dynamics | Self-deprecating from vendor side |
| Trend Roast | Making fun of buzzwords |

**B2B Constraints:** Validation > catharsis. LinkedIn-safe baseline. Self-deprecating > attacking.

---

## Visual Philosophy

| Principle | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| Cognitive load | One focal point, one joke |
| Authenticity | Intentional lo-fi > corporate polish |
| Visual metaphor | Image IS the joke, not decoration |
| Contrast | Before/after, split screens work |
| Stock photos | Avoid. Use screenshots, candid-style |
| Typography | lowercase = gen-z, ALL CAPS = emphasis |
| Scroll-stop | 0.5 sec to hook. Need face/contrast |

**Lo-Fi Spectrum:**
```
Screenshots → iPhone photo → Designed → Studio
Twitter       TikTok         Instagram   LinkedIn
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

| Don't | Do Instead |
|-------|------------|
| Brand as hero | Customer struggle as hero |
| Copy meme formats | Original visual metaphors |
| Force trend hijack | Only genuine connections |
| Explain the joke | Trust the audience |
| Logo prominent | Brand through profile only |
| Play it safe | Take real positions |

---

## Concept Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Calendar Hell (B2B, Catharsis)
**Setup:** Screenshot-style calendar, every hour blocked with meetings
**Copy:** "Productivity tip: Remove all the meetings about meetings"
**Visual:** Muted, realistic, 1:1 square

### Pattern 2: The Hypocrisy Split (B2C, Validation)
**Setup:** Split-screen showing contradictory behavior
**Copy:** "The math ain't mathing"
**Visual:** iPhone aesthetic, 9:16 vertical, gen-z lowercase

### Pattern 3: The Subverted Expectation (B2B, Hope)
**Setup:** Before/after where BOTH show same reaction
**Copy:** "It never gets less scary. You just get better at pretending."
**Visual:** Dark mode aesthetic, monospace font

## Workflow

1. Read research → extract pain points + customer language
2. Identify 3-5 tension points (expectation vs reality)
3. Match each to emotional target + humor pattern
4. Check platform constraints (tone ceiling, visual style)
5. Draft concepts → run 11pm test
6. Build visual direction using lo-fi spectrum
7. Create image prompts: scene, composition, color, text treatment

---

## Quick Reference

- **Ratio:** 70/30 entertainment/brand
- **Test:** 11pm friend test
- **Visual:** Image should work without text
- **Copy:** Customer words, not marketing speak
- **Platform:** Match where it lives
- **One rule:** One feeling per meme
