The center door is larger, made of warm terracotta clay with a soft green glow emanating from within. The surrounding doors are in muted sage and cream tones, creating depth through repetition.\n\nThe clay has that satisfying handmade quality—visible finger-pressed textures, soft rounded edges on each miniature door, matte finish with gentle highlights catching light from above. The entire network sits on a deep navy (#011a40) platform.\n\nFrame the composition with a thick 10-pixel border in teal (#46be8a), neo-brutalist style but warm. Generous negative space at top.\n\nTypography: Bold sans-serif headline \"350+ LENDERS\" in cream white, stacked. Below: \"One search. 60 seconds.\" in the same teal as the border, lighter weight.\n\nThe mood is clarity through abundance—not overwhelming, but empowering.

But the figure is turning toward a fourth door—this one in vibrant teal (#46be8a), slightly ajar with warm golden light spilling through the gap.\n\nThe clay textures are essential: the rejected doors show deliberate imperfections, almost like they've been pressed closed. The open door has smooth, inviting edges. Subtle fingerprint impressions throughout give handmade authenticity.\n\nBackground: Soft cream (#F5F0E8) with a confident 8-pixel deep navy (#011a40) border framing the scene.\n\nTypography in the upper negative space: \"REJECTED 3 TIMES\" in bold charcoal, then below in teal: \"Approved in 48 hours.\"\n\nThe emotional note: resilience and relief—not pity.

Inside, 6 or 7 miniature cream-colored clay houses tumble through, some already collected at the bottom, others mid-fall.\n\nThe hourglass sits slightly off-center on a deep navy (#011a40) surface.

Outside the magnifying glass: the same scene but in flat, muted gray—like an undeveloped photograph.\n\nThe magnifying glass itself is chunky, tactile clay with visible fingerprint texture on the handle.
