From its peak, 350 thin threads radiate outward like a network—each thread a different lender connection, rendered in subtle warm terracotta and cream tones. The tower has satisfying finger-pressed texture, handmade imperfections that make it feel crafted, not manufactured.\n\nThe background is deep navy (#011a40) with a thick 10-pixel teal border framing the composition. The contrast is intentional—dark corporate world, bright solution cutting through.\n\nGenerous negative space on the left holds bold stacked typography: \"350+ LENDERS\" in warm cream, followed by \"60 SECONDS\" below it. At the bottom, smaller supporting text: \"One search. All options.\" in the same teal as the tower.\n\nThe mood is confident efficiency—not overwhelming choice, but curated power.

The checkmark has visible fingerprint impressions, soft rounded edges, real dimensionality. Between the X's and the checkmark, a subtle 48-hour clock face pressed into the surface.\n\nThe entire scene sits on a warm cream base. A thick, confident navy (#011a40) border frames everything—neo-brutalist but warm. Shadows are soft, grounding each element in space.\n\nTypography in the upper negative space: \"REJECTED 3 TIMES\" in muted charcoal, crossed out with a single terracotta line.
