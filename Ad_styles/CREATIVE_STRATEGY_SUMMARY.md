# Creative Strategy Summary
## Mortgage Conversion Ad Campaign

---

## Overview

This document summarizes our creative strategy development for conversion-focused mortgage advertising (residential + commercial) on Meta platforms.

---

## The Challenge

| Constraint | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Meta Special Ad Category | Cannot target by age, gender, zip code |
| Compliance restrictions | Cannot promote specific rates (e.g., "5.99% APR") |
| Crowded market | Need scroll-stopping distinctiveness |
| Trust deficit | Financial services often feel cold/corporate |
| Conversion focus | Must drive action, not just awareness |

## Recommended Art Styles

### Primary Style: Soft Brutalism + 3D Clay

**What it is:** Bold neo-brutalist borders and typography combined with warm, handcrafted 3D clay elements.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Thick, intentional borders (8-12px) in warm colors
- 3D clay objects with visible finger-pressed textures
- Matte finish with subtle highlights
- Soft, rounded edges on dimensional elements
- Generous negative space (40%+ of composition)

**Color Palette:**
| Role | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| Primary Warm | Terracotta | #C4755B |
| Secondary Calm | Sage Green | #87A087 |
| Neutral Light | Warm Cream | #F5F0E8 |
| Neutral Dark | Deep Charcoal | #2D2D2D |
| Accent Energy | Warm Coral | #E8846B |

**Why it works:**
- Hard borders = confidence, stability (what you want in a lender)
- Soft clay = human touch, approachability (what you want in a guide)
- The contrast creates visual tension that stops the scroll
- Handmade aesthetic differentiates from stock photo competitors

---

### Secondary Style: Surrealist Scale

**What it is:** Ordinary objects at impossible, dreamlike scales—creating visual surprise that forces the brain to pause and process.

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Dramatic size relationships (object 10-20x larger than figure)
- Dreamlike atmospheric landscapes
- Golden hour or soft diffused lighting
- Minimal environments that emphasize the scale distortion
- Photorealistic rendering with painterly qualities

**Psychology Behind It:**
1. Pattern interruption — "Wait, that's not right"
2. Curiosity — "Why is that so big/small?"
3. Emotional resonance — Scale carries symbolic meaning

**Why it works:**
- Maximum scroll-stop power
- Communicates significance of homeownership milestone
- Memorable and shareable
- Differentiates completely from competitor aesthetics

---

## Creative Approach: Visual Metaphor Advertising

**Definition:** Abstract concepts (homeownership, financial journey) represented by tangible symbolic objects.

**Power:** One-second comprehension. Viewer doesn't need to read—the visual metaphor communicates instantly.

### Developed Metaphor Concepts

| Metaphor | Visual | Emotional Territory |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **The Key** | Oversized clay key, home-shaped head | Achievement, trust, "something valuable handed to you" |
| **The Bridge** | Two platforms connected by bridge | Progress, journey, getting from here to there |
| **The Roots** | House with organic roots spreading beneath | Stability, belonging, long-term security |
| **The Door** | Standalone door ajar with warm glow | Possibility, invitation, threshold moment |

### Infinite Expansion

These are starting points. Visual metaphors can include:
- Ladders, stepping stones, compasses, maps
- Anchors, nests, seeds growing, puzzle pieces
- Lighthouses, open windows, pathways
- Handshakes, umbrellas (protection), foundations
- Blueprints coming to life, keys in locks

**The rule:** Match metaphor to the emotional truth of that specific ad.

## Design Philosophy Framework

### 6 Core Principles

#### 1. Intentional Contrast Creates Tension
Pair opposing forces deliberately:
- Soft clay + hard borders
- Warm terracotta + cool sage
- Bold headlines + delicate supporting text
- Organic shapes + geometric frames

#### 2. Restraint is Strength (Strategic Negative Space)
- 40%+ of composition should breathe
- One hero object, not a cluttered scene
- Let the eye rest, then focus
- Emptiness signals confidence

#### 3. Typography as Architecture
- Headlines have weight and presence
- Clear hierarchy: primary → secondary → tertiary
- Type should feel built, not decorated
- Sans-serif for modernity, serif for premium moments

#### 4. Materiality Creates Believability
Specific textures sell authenticity:
- Glossy but not plastic
- Visible finger-pressed impressions in clay
- Soft shadows grounding objects in space
- Matte finishes with subtle light catching edges

#### 5. Emotional Truth Over Feature Lists
Sell feelings, not processes:
- Not "Fast pre-approval" → "Confidence when you need it"
- Not "Low rates" → "More room to breathe"
- Not "Easy application" → "We handle the complexity"

#### 6. Distinctive Signature Creates Recognition
Ownable visual language:
- Consistent color palette across all touchpoints
- Recurring border treatment
- Same clay materiality
- Typography system that's yours alone

## Nano Banana Pro Prompting Approach

### Golden Rules (from Official Guide)

1. **Edit, don't re-roll** — Use multi-turn conversation to refine
2. **Natural language, not tag soups** — Write like briefing a creative director
3. **Be specific about materiality** — Describe textures, light, surfaces
4. **Provide context** — The "why" and "for whom"
5. **Structural control** — Use sketches/wireframes for layout precision

### Prompt Structure Template

```
[FORMAT & PLATFORM]
Create a [aspect ratio] [platform] ad for [client type].

[THE CONCEPT - What & Why]
The scene/visual: [Detailed description of the visual metaphor]

[MATERIALITY - How it Feels]
[Specific textures, surfaces, light behavior, tactile qualities]

[COMPOSITION - Where Things Live]
[Layout, negative space, framing, visual hierarchy]

[TYPOGRAPHY - The Words]
[Headlines, supporting text, placement, style]

[EMOTIONAL NOTE - The Feeling]
[The mood, what it should evoke, what it should NOT feel like]

[TECHNICAL]
Aspect ratio [X:X], high resolution for [platform] placement.
```

## Example Prompts

### Prompt 1: "The Key Moment" (Soft Brutalism + 3D Clay)

```
Create a square social media ad for a mortgage broker targeting first-time homebuyers.

The scene: A single oversized house key made of glossy terracotta clay, positioned slightly off-center to the right. The key has satisfying weight and dimensionality—you can see the subtle finger-pressed texture in the clay, soft highlights catching light from the upper left. The key head is shaped like a simplified home silhouette.

Behind the key, a soft sage green background with a thick, confident 8-pixel warm coral border framing the entire composition. The border feels hand-drawn but precise—intentionally imperfect.

In the generous negative space to the left, bold sans-serif text reads "YOUR FIRST HOME" in deep charcoal, stacked vertically. Below it, smaller but equally confident: "starts with the right guide" in the same coral as the border.

The mood is warm confidence—not corporate, not salesy. Like a trusted friend handing you something valuable. The clay material makes homeownership feel tangible, achievable, something you can literally hold.

Small logo placement bottom right corner, subtle. No other text or calls-to-action cluttering the frame.

Aspect ratio 1:1, high resolution for Meta feed placement.
```

### Prompt 2: "The Bridge" (Soft Brutalism + 3D Clay)

```
Design a vertical Instagram story ad for commercial mortgage services targeting small business owners.

The concept: A miniature 3D clay scene showing two platforms—one representing "where you are" (a small, simple building shape in muted gray clay) and one representing "where you're going" (a larger, more established building in warm terracotta). Between them, a solid bridge in sage green clay connects the two.

The entire scene sits on a creamy off-white surface, shot from a slightly elevated 3/4 angle so you see depth and dimension. The clay has that satisfying handmade quality—subtle fingerprint impressions, soft rounded edges, matte finish with gentle highlights.

Frame the scene with a thick black border (neo-brutalist style) but keep the interior warm and approachable. The contrast between hard border and soft clay creates visual tension that stops the scroll.

Typography: "GROW INTO YOUR NEXT SPACE" in bold, architectural sans-serif at the top—the words have presence and weight. Smaller supporting text below: "Commercial financing, simplified" in a lighter weight.

The feeling is momentum and possibility—not intimidating financial jargon, but a clear visual metaphor anyone can understand in 0.5 seconds. The handcrafted clay aesthetic signals human touch in an industry that often feels cold.

Aspect ratio 9:16 for Stories placement, high resolution.
```

### Prompt 3: "Roots" (Soft Brutalism + 3D Clay)

```
Create a square social media ad for a mortgage broker emphasizing long-term stability and family homes.

The visual: A charming miniature house made of warm terracotta clay—simple geometric form with a pitched roof, single door, two windows. The house has that handcrafted quality with soft rounded edges and visible finger-smoothed surfaces.

The distinctive element: From beneath the house, organic root shapes in sage green clay spread downward and outward, like a tree establishing itself. The roots have gentle curves, varying thickness, and that satisfying clay materiality—matte with subtle light catching the edges.

Background: A rich, deep forest green that makes the warm terracotta pop. Framed with a thick cream-colored border (12 pixels) that feels substantial and intentional.

Typography positioned in the upper third: "PUT DOWN ROOTS" in bold, warm off-white sans-serif—the letters feel grounded and confident. Below in smaller text: "Find your forever home" in a softer weight, same cream color.

The composition breathes—the house and roots occupy maybe 50% of the frame, letting negative space do its work. The eye travels naturally from text to house to roots.

The emotional note: Security without stuffiness. Growth that feels organic, not forced. The handmade clay whispers "real people, real homes" not "corporate lender."

Aspect ratio 1:1, high resolution for Meta feed.
```

### Prompt 4: "The Door" (Soft Brutalism + 3D Clay)

```
Design a vertical ad for Instagram showing the moment of possibility in homeownership.

The scene: A standalone door frame made of smooth cream-colored clay, slightly ajar, positioned center-right in the frame. Through the open door, a warm golden-yellow glow emanates—not harsh, but inviting like afternoon sunlight in a new home. The door itself has a simple round doorknob in terracotta clay.

The door frame casts a soft shadow on a sage green surface beneath it, grounding the object in space. The clay has beautiful imperfections—subtle texture variations, soft edges where forms meet, that handmade quality that says "crafted with care."

Background: Split composition—deep charcoal on the left (where the typography lives), transitioning to softer sage on the right where the door sits. This creates natural visual flow and reading hierarchy.

Bold text on the dark left side: "WHAT'S ON THE OTHER SIDE?" stacked vertically in warm coral. Below it, smaller: "Let's find out together" in cream—warmer, more personal.

The thick border here is terracotta-colored, creating a warm frame around the entire scene. The border feels like it's holding the composition together with intention.

The mood: Curiosity and warmth. Not "ACT NOW" urgency but "something wonderful awaits" anticipation. The partially open door is an invitation, not a demand.

Aspect ratio 9:16 for Stories, high resolution.
```

### Prompt 5: "The Biggest Step" (Surrealist Scale)

```
Create a square social media ad using surrealist scale for a mortgage broker.

The scene: A vast, dreamy cream-colored landscape stretches to a soft horizon—minimal, almost abstract. In the center, an enormous vintage-style key stands upright, monumental like a sculpture. The key is warm bronze with subtle patina and beautiful imperfections.

At the base of the key, a tiny silhouetted figure (gender-neutral, simple) looks upward at it—the scale difference is dramatic, the key perhaps 20 times their height.

The lighting is golden hour warm, casting a long soft shadow from the key across the landscape. The sky graduates from soft peach near the horizon to pale blue above.

No harsh borders here—the surreal dreamscape IS the frame. Typography floats in the sky area: "THE BIGGEST STEP" in elegant serif, warm charcoal color. Below the figure, smaller: "We'll help you take it" in the same tone.

The mood is awe and possibility—not intimidating, but inspiring. The impossible scale makes homeownership feel like the significant life moment it truly is, while the warm colors keep it inviting rather than cold.

Aspect ratio 1:1, high resolution, photorealistic rendering with painterly atmospheric quality.
