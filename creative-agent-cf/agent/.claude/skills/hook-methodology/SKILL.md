# Hook Methodology

Insight-first approach to conversion copy. The hook stops the scroll—but only if it enters the conversation already happening in the customer's mind.

## Core Philosophy

```
Insight first. Formula never.

The best hooks don't come from matching data to templates.
They come from discovering what's never been said about what everyone already feels.

Research IS the creative work. If you're not sitting with it until it speaks,
you're just filling in blanks.
```

---

## Phase 1: Immersion

Read `agent/files/research/{brand}_research.md`

### First Pass: Absorb
Read the entire research file without stopping to analyze. Let it wash over you.

### Second Pass: Feel
Read again, but this time ask yourself:

> "What made me FEEL something?"

Not "what data is useful" — what landed emotionally? What surprised you? What felt unfair? What made you angry on behalf of the customer?

**Mark 5 moments that created an emotional response.**

These are your insight seeds. Everything else is noise.

### Third Pass: Swipe Language
Go to the ICP section. Extract **5 verbatim phrases** — the actual words customers use.

Not marketing language. Their language.

| Marketing Speak | Their Actual Words |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Customers seek affordable options" | "I'm wasting so much on rent" |
| "Users experience confusion" | "I don't even know where to start" |
| "Prospects face rejection" | "Banks keep rejecting me" |

These phrases ARE your hooks. You just need to find them.

---

## Phase 2: The Messy Middle

This is where insight lives. Don't skip it.

### Go Deeper on Each Insight Seed

For each of your 5 marked moments, ask:

**Level 1 — External (what they'd say):**
> "What's the surface problem here?"

**Level 2 — Internal (the real struggle):**
> "What does this make them FEEL about themselves?"

**Level 3 — Philosophical (why it matters):**
> "What do they believe they DESERVE that they're not getting?"

Example:
```
External: "I need to find a mortgage rate"
Internal: "I feel stupid and overwhelmed — like everyone else knows something I don't"
Philosophical: "I work hard. I deserve a fair shot at owning a home."
```

**Most brands only address Level 1. The breakthrough is choosing Level 2 or 3.**

### The Ownership Question

For each insight, ask:

> "Can ONLY this brand say this?"

If a competitor could say the exact same thing, go deeper. Find the angle that's unique to:
- This brand's specific proof points
- This brand's specific customer
- This brand's specific perspective

---

## Phase 3: Connectivity

Great hooks connect unexpected things. Look for:

### What would make the customer say "finally, someone gets it"?
The insight that names something they've felt but never heard articulated.

### What's hiding in plain sight?
The obvious truth about the industry that nobody says out loud.

### What would piss off competitors?
The angle that exposes what others don't want discussed.

### What's the unexpected frame?
- If everyone talks about SAVING money, talk about what money MEANS
- If everyone talks about SPEED, talk about what waiting COSTS emotionally
- If everyone talks about FEATURES, talk about IDENTITY

### Write Raw Observations
Not hooks yet. Just observations.

```
"The real problem isn't finding a rate — it's feeling like you're going to screw up
the biggest financial decision of your life."

"Banks make the process confusing on purpose. Confusion benefits them."

"First-time buyers don't just want approval. They want someone to say 'you're not
crazy, you CAN do this.'"
```

These become hooks. But not yet.

---

## Phase 4: First Drafts (Then Reject Them)

### Write 10 Raw Hook Attempts
Fast. Don't edit. Let them be ugly.

### Cross Out the First 5
They're the obvious ones. Everyone would write these.

The first thought is rarely the best thought. Ogilvy threw away his first 20 attempts.

### Push the Remaining 5
For each survivor, ask:
- Can I make it more specific? (Add a number, name, or timeframe)
- Can I make it more emotional? (Go to Level 2 or 3)
- Can I make it more unexpected? (Flip the frame)

---

## Phase 5: Brand Voice Filter

Read each hook aloud. Does it sound like this brand?

### Check Research for Brand Voice
The research captured brand voice. Use it.

| Brand Voice | Hook Treatment |
|-------------|----------------|
| Playful + Confident | Casual language, subtle wit, conversational rhythm |
| Premium + Authoritative | Direct statements, no hedging, commanding tone |
| Warm + Supportive | Empathetic framing, "we" language, reassuring |
| Technical + Precise | Data-forward, specific metrics, no fluff |

### Inject Customer Language
Where possible, use the verbatim phrases you swiped. Their words are more powerful than your clever rewrites.

---

## Phase 6: Validation

**These are principles, not formulas. Use them to CHECK your work, not to GENERATE it.**

### Specificity Check
Does it have at least one of:
- A specific number from research
- A specific timeframe
- A specific customer situation
- A specific contrast

> "Fast approvals" ❌ → "48-hour approval when banks take 3 weeks" ✓

### Emotional Truth Check
Does it name a feeling, not just a feature?

> "Compare rates from 350 lenders" ❌ → "Stop guessing. See every option." ✓

### 3-Second Check
If someone scrolling at full speed sees this for 3 seconds, do they get it?

Read it fast. If you have to re-read, simplify.

### Ownership Check
Could a competitor use this exact hook by changing the logo?

If yes, it's not done. Find what makes it YOURS.

### Conversation Check
Does this enter a conversation already happening in their head?

Or does it start a new conversation they don't care about?

---

## Phase 7: Diversity Verification

**Only AFTER you've crafted hooks through insight, check for emotional diversity.**

Map your 6 final hooks. Do they cover different emotional territories?

You don't need to hit specific categories. But you DO need variety:

- Are some hooks about FEAR and some about HOPE?
- Are some hooks about IDENTITY and some about OUTCOME?
- Are some hooks provocative and some reassuring?

If they all feel the same emotionally, go back to Phase 3 and find different connections.

---

## Phase 8: Write Supporting Copy

For each hook, add:

**Body:** 1-2 sentences that:
- Expand the emotional truth (don't just repeat the hook)
- Add proof or specificity
- Bridge to the CTA

**CTA:** Action + Implied Outcome

| Weak CTA | Strong CTA |
|----------|------------|
| "Learn more" | "See your options" |
| "Apply now" | "Get your answer" |
| "Contact us" | "Talk to someone who gets it" |

The CTA should feel like the natural next step, not a demand.

## The Hard Rules

### Never Do This
- Copy the structure of an example you've seen
- Start with a formula and fill in blanks
- Use the first hook that comes to mind
- Write hooks that could work for any brand in the category
- Ignore the customer's actual language
- Skip the messy middle

### Always Do This
- Sit with research until something makes you FEEL
- Go deeper than the external problem
- Reject your first instincts
- Sound like the brand, not like "marketing"
- Use their words, not your clever rewrites
- Ask "can only WE say this?"

---

## Remember

The goal is not to produce 6 hooks.

The goal is to find 6 truths that only this brand can say,
in a way that enters the conversation already happening in the customer's mind.

If you're not uncomfortable rejecting your first ideas, you're not pushing hard enough.
