Let me guess:

You make great income. Your business is thriving.

But the bank wants 2 years of perfect tax returns.

They don't understand 1099s, business deductions, or fluctuating income.

They see your tax strategy as "insufficient income."

You're not high-risk. You're just speaking a different language.

**Emotional Tone:** Frustration → Understanding

### PRIMARY HEADLINE (125 chars)
```
Buying a duplex? Rural property? Mixed-use building? Good luck with traditional banks.
```

### BODY COPY (Instagram Feed)
```
PROBLEM:
Your property doesn't fit the bank's cookie-cutter criteria.

❌ "We don't lend on properties over 1 hour from major cities."
❌ "No mixed residential-commercial."

✓ Multi-unit properties
✓ Rural and recreational
✓ Mixed-use buildings
✓ Unique construction
✓ Land and development

Our AI matches your specific property type with lenders who specialize in it.
